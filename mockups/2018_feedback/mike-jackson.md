# Mike Jackson
* Main user of Montagu in this group (MenA)
* SAS model, project to try and bring it over to R. Institution mostly uses SAS,
  but there are things that R does better, and so desire to use it more. Also to
  be compatible with us.

## Existing
* "Never entirely understood the terminology around touchstones"
* Had trouble finding demographic data into the test touchstone, that seems
  cleared up now
* Uploading central estimates pretty quick
* Lot of back and forth over the coverage data, but Montagu was fine
* Not a problem to filter demographic data to relevant countries.
* Stochastic parameters all made sense.
* Can't use Dropbox from work - has to take his laptop home to upload!
* Montagu "has simplified a lot of things from our end" :)

## Prototype
* Misunderstood touchstone version page, thought it was four estimate uploads
  by one group.
* Likes the checkbox selection, the gender selection.
* Wasn't clear you could get the figure preview.

## Improvements
* Want to check that all expected rows are present in upload. But maybe still 
  allow upload on error, just warn user?
* Make figure preview clearer?
* Avoid use of Dropbox
* Indicate which version of the model that was used, snapshot the code etc.
