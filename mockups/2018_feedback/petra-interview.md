# Petra (LSHTM)
Principally working on Rotavirus & Measles

## Feedback
* Link between parameters file and stochastic template were clear
* Two uses: Download and upload
* Templates are seen as a specification of what's needed
* "It's good that it's all there; it's fantastic, we get can get all the data 
  we need... instead of digging for it"

## Improvements
* Make Montagu link more obvious on www.vaccineimpact.org. Looked under 
  "resources".
* Type error on refreshing token after clicking download file in Safari
* "Choose file" instead of "Upload estimates for this scenario" in burden
  estimates page
* Make it clearer that burden estimate upload is for central estimates (as 
  opposed to stochastic)
* The decision for modellers who work on multiple diseases should be to choose
  a disease first, rather than a modelling group. The easiest way to fix this
  would just be to have one group per disease for LSHTM.
* Target ages and age range verbatim fields were unclear.
* Excel stripped out quotes when saving to CSV. We shouldn't require strings
  without bad characters to be quoted.
* Good to download all input data in a single file, or maybe one for each of
  demograhics, coverage, template.
* It's not clear what wide and long are. Give brief inline explanation?
* Parameters page doesn't make it clear that it's for stochastic data.
* No explanation of parameter certificates?
* Separate out download and upload in the UI from the beginning, and separate
  out central and stochastic in upload. Templates should be in the download
  section.
