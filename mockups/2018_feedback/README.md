In February 2018 Alex and Martin conducted feedback sessions with:

* Petra (LSHTM)
* Kaja (LSHTM)
* Katy (IC-Garske)
* Kevin (LSHTM)
* Margaret (??)

We:

1. Ran them through the contrib portal and got feedback on that
2. Engaged in paper protyping around existing and desired features for the 
   contrib portal.

In March, the plan is to do more of the same activities at the 2018 annual 
meeting and also to show wireframes from the first round of feeback.
