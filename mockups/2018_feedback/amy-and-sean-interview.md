# Amy and Sean
* Both used Montagu briefly for RFP
* R model - they would prefer to use R to interface with Montagu
* 4 in their group total - Amy and Sean and their two PIs

## Walking through existing portal
* Getting demographic data is straight foward
* Long and wide coverage didn't match up for campaign - presumably the known 
  problem with multiple data points for single year
* Various problems that were for the RFP only
* Stochastic stuff (which they hadn't seen previously) seemed straight forward
  to them.

## New prototype
* New touchstone list is "way nicer"
* Have modellers found it useful to go back to their old estimates?
* With explanation, said touchstone version list was nice, but they didn't have
  a very strong idea of what a touchstone even was, so maybe take with a pinch
  of salt. Sean said that in his history of using DHS data, he would really have
  liked to have the changelog, as many changes have been irrelevant to him.
  Sean liked it more than Amy.
* New download page is nice.

## Improvements
* Button to download all data
* Doesn't like the yellow warning alerts
