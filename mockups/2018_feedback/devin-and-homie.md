# Devin and Homie
* Bought 5 new computers, will be buying more for next round
* Currently using Excel & VBA
* Converted to C# Analytica. Considering converting to R

## Existing
* Upload is stressful near deadline as you have to wait for each one to finish
  before starting the next.
* Stochastic is easier, as you can just throw them all on Dropbox.
* Feeling snowed under by emails - want urgent communications to stand out from
  routine.

## Prototype
* They agree that they do all the downloads, them all the uploads
* New download page "very nice"

## Improvements
* See file name after upload to reduce confusion
* Better progress indicator when uploading - can't tell whether it's failed or
  still going
* Upload multiple central estimates at once, like Dropbox - throw them in and 
  wait. Queue them up?
* Some way to reduce email flood:
    - Moving communications inside Montagu (possibly)
    - Kim tag emails by urgency
    - I suggested they use Slack
