# Sean Moore
* RFP
* YF and Japanese Encephilitis
* With Alex Perkins, the main users. May gain some postdocs.
* R model

## Existing
* Downloaded population and births, went fine
* Coverage was a bit confusing
* Upload makes sense. Maybe not clear how much info needed when registering 
  estimates.

## Prototype
* Misunderstood version history page as multiple user submissions

## Improvements
* Subnational data would be useful
* Definitions of the CSV columns for coverage data before you download
