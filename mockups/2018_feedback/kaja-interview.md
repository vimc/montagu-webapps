## Steps she would take on a new touchstone
1. First step, redownload updated demographic data. Exactly the same files as
   last time. Tricky because the filenames don't match the demographic data sets
   display names. Only uses long format.
1. Download all the coverage data. Only uses long format.
1. Get template files.
1. Run reports to visualize coverage and templates - only worked for test 
   touchstone; real touchstone was too big.
1. Run scripts to derive data from input data - e.g. down to admin level 1
1. Re-estimate using input data and previous estimates. Takes a few days. MCMC.
1. Write outputs to Montagu format, using template files as an input to get the
   countries etc. right.
1. Upload central estimates (had trouble because of excel/csv upload bug). Had 
   no trouble with error messages is upload.

## Improvements
* Plot coverage data before download. Looking for values that will upset code
  e.g. more than 100% coverage. Maybe also plot demographic data? Templates?
* Make link between demographic data set names and the resulting filenames 
  clearer.
* Redownload demographic files from last time in a single click / build a 
  default data set.
* Checkboxes to select demographic files wanted and then download all checked
  ones in a single click. (Remember checked from last time?)
* Two pages: "This is everything you're going to need to download" and then
  another page for uploads. No need for more steps in process.
* One zip download for each of demographics, demographics, templates.
* "Quite like having to click onto a different page for each upload" so as to
  avoid mistakes. So keep that at one page per scenario.
* Summary of what's changed in this touchstone / touchstone version on 
  touchstone landing page, then links to the download and upload pages. No need
  to summarise scenarios at this stage.
* Hide existing responsibilities guidance behind a link on the touchstone 
  landing page.
* Click graph icon next to each of demographic and coverage downloads to show
  inline report on right side of page. Also templates?

"It works really well" :)
