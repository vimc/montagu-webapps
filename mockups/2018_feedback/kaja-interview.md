# Kaja (LSHTM-Jit and LSHTM-Clark)) - Chrome on Windows

Had been onboarded by Kevin

"The system works well"
"Any system, once you get accustomed to it it's fine"

Had printed all the guidance material
"It's pretty intuitive"

Kevin has downloaded all the data sets, demography, coverage and put them in a folder

Demographic download page: "This is good", liked downloading things individually rather than in one zip

Responsibilities: "it's actually pretty good, I cannot think of any... this is good, it's simple"

"The scenarios are well explained"

"from your perspective, is this system working for you?"

Upload test didn't work because of mime type bug :( So couldn't test error message clarity re self-correcting etc

Very positive about the usefulness of the diagnostic report received, had it printed out

Qs:
- can the diagnostic report be generated immediately or does it take time?
- could we generate it ourselves to check our own data before uploading?

They are using our diagnostic report for quality control of their estimates

"As long as this thing runs without generating errors, that is good. The only thing, one additional feature is if we
could generate this report [to reduce time between generating estimates and getting feedback]"

"The design features are fine. It's not that critical."


## My takeways
There is limited need/desire for a design overhaul, it may be a mistake to spend a lot of time on it!
Getting diagnostic reporting in the portal is a priority
