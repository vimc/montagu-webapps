                Both coverage and demographic datasets to be used in the full
                model runs are available for download through Montagu. Please
                download and use these datasets, rather than your own datasets
                to ensure consistency of estimates across the Consortium.

                The first set of full model runs generated within the VIMC will
                assume vaccination coverage as detailed in Gaviâ€™s Operational
                Forecast v15 (OP15, released October 2017), which gives coverage
                for both routine and campaign vaccination in the Gavi 73 countries
                from 2017 to 2030. This is combined with coverage data from various
                other sources, some of which has been extrapolated by the VIMC
                secretariat, in order to cover all countries and time periods.

                Each scenario is based on vaccination coverage from up to 3
                different coverage sets (e.g. routine and campaign). The
                datasets to download contain data on all coverage sets to be
                included in a particular scenario. Note that there are no
                coverage sets included in the no vaccination scenario, and
                therefore the coverage file does not contain any data apart
                from the header row.

            </p>
            <p>
                A. No. In order to ensure consistency between all models, you
                must use the demographic data provided via Montagu.

                <b>Q. Why does male + female not equal the total population?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                A. This is a property of the UNWPP data; they provide separate
                data for male, female, and total, and we provide the same data.

                <b>Q. Why is population at birth (age 0) not the same as the
                number of births?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                A. In UNWPP data, age '0-0' refers to all people under 1 year
                old on a particular reference day. This will differ from the
                number of births into this cohort during the year due to the
                timing, and the effects of infant mortality and migration.

                A. We are working on this functionality for future runs, but
                for the current runs you will need to download each demographic
                dataset separately.
