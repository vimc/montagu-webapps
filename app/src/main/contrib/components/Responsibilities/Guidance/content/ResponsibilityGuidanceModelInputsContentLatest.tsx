                The first set of full model runs generated within the VIMC will
                assume vaccination coverage as detailed in Gaviâ€™s Operational
                Forecast v16 (OP16, released November 2018), which gives coverage
                for both routine and campaign vaccination in the Gavi 73 countries
                from 2018 to 2030. This is combined with coverage data from various
                other sources, some of which has been extrapolated by the VIMC
                secretariat, in order to cover all countries and time periods.

                Each scenario is based on vaccination coverage from one or more different coverage sets (e.g. routine and campaign). The datasets to download contain data on all coverage sets to be included in a particular scenario. Note that there are no coverage sets included in the no vaccination scenario, and therefore the coverage file does not contain any data apart from the header row.

            <p>
                <b>gavi_support</b> indicates per-year Gavi support. Where this is total, this means the coverage was Gavi-funded.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>age_range_verbatim</b> is a description of the age range. We have used this to infer <b>age_first</b> and <b>age_last</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>coverage</b> shows the level of vaccination coverage, usually ranging from 0 (0%) to 1 (100%). In some cases, this value may be greater than 1. For example, if a campaign originally targets 1 million people but ends up vaccinating 1.1 million people, the coverage would be shown as 1.1 (equating to 110%).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>target</b> is the number of individuals in the target population. Where target is shown as a value, this means the target population for the vaccination is different from the population shown in the demographic data downloads. For example, the vaccination may be a campaign targeting particular regions or cohorts. Where target is shown as <b>NA</b>, you should assume the target population matches the population shown in the demographic data downloads.

            </p>
            <p>
                A. No. In order to ensure consistency between all models, you
                must use the demographic data provided via Montagu.

                <b>Q. Why does male + female not equal the total population?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                A. This is a property of the UNWPP data; they provide separate
                data for male, female, and total, and we provide the same data.

            </p>
            <p>
                A. In UNWPP data, age '0-0' refers to all people under 1 year
                old on a particular reference day. This will differ from the
                number of births into this cohort during the year due to the
                timing, and the effects of infant mortality and migration.
